- 👋 Hi, My name is Amy.
- 👀 I am currently a Graduate Engineer at a large Australian Bank.
- 🌱 I'm fairly new to software development/engineering. 
- 💞️ My previous work experiences and internships have been on systems engineering/operations, but I wanted to try focusing on development and so my journey starts.
- 📫 You can find my blog on amypark1033.github.io
